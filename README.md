# Twitter Profiler 

Twitter Profiler is a tool to download data about users in Twitter and analyze it in a simple manner. The tool implements some basic statistics about the usage patterns of the user and attempts to profile the user. The goal of the tool is to analyze the features and properties of users in Twitter and help identify different types of users. Twitter Profiler implements a comparison of users by plotting the shared friends of multiple users. It can take a large amount of users, analyze who they follow (friends) and graph only those friends that are followed by a defined amount of users. 

It answers the question: Which users are followed simultaneously by the accounts xx,yy,zz,aa,bb?

                        improve the graph (e.g. cat graph.dot |sfdp -Tpng -o
                        graph2.png). Use -m to limit the minimum amount of
                        shared connections you want in the graph.

# TODO
- Download the id of followers and friends instead of the complete objects
- Store the data in a neo4j
- Compute new features
- The language of tweets make it only for not retweeted tweets
- For computing user mentions, use ids and not screen names
- compare two users
- Give me one user and monitor it in real time continually. Store new and old followers, etc.
